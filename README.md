# MUN Resolution Writer
This is an open-source tool to make drafting resolutions in MUN committees far easier. It is a python-based desktop app made with PyQt5 and python-docx library. It takes in raw text data and generates a .docx file which is fully formatted and ready to submit. I made this tool because I have personal experience of my entire resolution being scrapped due to formatting errors XD. You can check out the main.py file for the source code, or simply run the standalone exe file to use this app.
